    We can see Sam Sulek, one of our instructors preparing for a 5 plate squat set, to demonstrate a proper squat form. Meanwhile, we can hear his monologue in which he states the following:
    "that had to be 99.9% effort on that - last one I didn't think I was going to make it 
    okay let's get the [ __ ] out  of here dude - my relationship with squats is passionate but toxic you know, we kind of cross paths and then I'm done - let's go to leg extensions ."
    
    After his monologue, we can see him walk up to the bar, the setup is a classic back sqat in a squat rack, with safety bars, and as most of the time, we can see a plate at Sam's foot which he will use to bias his quads a little bit better, placing his heels on top of it while doing the exercise. 
    And after some grunting, he manages to lift the weight, walk back a little to the plate underneath him, and he starts the exercise. Meanwhile, amidst of him grunting from putting so much effort in the perfect repetitions, we can see that literally everybody looks at him doing the squat amused by the raw power of him.

    He does exactly twelve reps, with proper form, and clearly high enough effort.
    Next, he says: "oh my God I'm not doing another set  of squats that was really good that..."
    Unfortunately, the video ends before he ends what he has to say.
